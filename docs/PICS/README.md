# Notes on contents of PICS/

.fig files have been generated with the `xfig` program.
From there exported to .png format.

Because picture sizes cannot easily be specified in .md,
they are loaded in absolute size.

### [shrink](./shrink)

Has a list of `convert` commands to produce the re-sized pictures
for this specific file list,
e.g. `2sf.png` converted to `2sf-.png`, which are used in the text.
