Note on .fig files:
Done with the `xfig` program.
Exported to .png format.
Because picture sizes cannot easily be specified in .md,
they are loaded in absolute size.
The file `shrink` of `convert` commands produces the resized pictures,
e.g. `2sf.png` converted to `2sf-.png`, which are used in the text.
