    information
    regarding the architecture, overall structure, incorporated frameworks and libraries. </p><br><br><br><br><br>
  <h2 #intro>INTRODUCTION</h2><br>
  <p>The first stable of version of GTE was written in Flash. Due to the constantly changing web requirements, it has
    been
    rewritten as part of a dissertation project using modern HTML5 technologies, namely with <a
      href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">Typescript</a> and
    <a href="https://phaser.io/">Phaser</a> - a 2D web-based game engine.<br><br>

    Phaser provides great functionality for writing the core of the software with ease - built-in canvas for drawing,
    input management, animations, signals and much more. The user interface, i.e. buttons, dialogs, windows are written
    separately. In the dissertation, the UI was written with <a href="https://jquery.com/">jQuery</a>.
    As the UI started to evolve it became clear that a
    more sophisticated framework had to replace jQuery, in this case, the developers chose <a
      href="https://angular.io/">Angular</a>.
    <br><br>

    Phaser GTE is incorporated into Angular as a plugin. Should the developers wish to rewrite or switch to another UI
    framework like <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a>, <a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue</a> or any other,
    they can extract the existing core and place it into their own project with only slight modifications.<br><br>

    The current version of Phaser is 2.11.0 CE (community edition). Version 3 of the game engine is available, but due
    to a missing core feature (namely, applying tints to sprites in Canvas), GTE currently uses Phaser 2.x,
    which will is still constantly updated by the community.<br><br>

    In the dissertation, the Phaser core of the software was initially written with the
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller">MVC design pattern</a>. In the
    newer version, slight modifications were made and now the project strictly follows the
    <a href="https://android.jlelse.eu/thoughts-on-clean-architecture-b8449d9d02df">CLEAN architecture</a>, while
    still preserving the Model, View and Controller separation. For a detailed overview of the Phaser core architecture,
    you can read the dissertation project.<br><br>

    Tutorials on Phaser can be found online (an online course by the developer of GTE can be seen
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUxpZr2Ekpg&list=PLRsPe93DnzPOrVx111HHMW0w4tXe0zdLb">here</a>),
    but we strongly recommend looking at the <a href="https://phaser.io/examples">examples</a> and
    <a href="https://phaser.io/docs/2.6.2/index">documentation</a> pages, as the
    course focuses more on game development.<br><br>

    The current version of Angular is 6. Google updates Angular twice a year, but usually the required modifications to
    an
    Angular project from version to version are minimal. Angular comes with a predefined architecture, which will be
    briefly
    discussed here. A good overview of this architecture can be seen in this
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svPlLuoTEaQ&t=55s">video</a>, or in the
    <a href="https://angular.io/guide/architecture">official documentation</a>.
    There are plenty of tutorials and examples written for Angular, but we recommend this 1 hour
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4JUm0Bq9AM">introduction
      video</a> and this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eWrpsCLMJQ&list=PLC3y8-rFHvwhBRAgFinJR8KHIrCdTkZcZ">
      tutorial series</a>. There is also a written <a href="https://angular.io/tutorial">tutorial</a> on angular.io,
    but it is slightly harder to follow and learn from. Angular has a bit of a steep learning curve, so if you
    do not have experience with it we strongly recommend checking some of the tutorials mentioned above, before
    starting work on the project.<br><br>

    There are other dependencies, such as <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/mathjs">mathjs</a>,
    <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/file-saver">FileSaver.js</a> and
    <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/angular2-draggable">angular2-draggable</a>,
    but their usage in the software is minimal and could be rewritten from scratch or swapped with other libraries
    relatively easily.<br><br>

    For the most part GTE works as standalone project - it does not communicate with backend services to draw or operate
    on game trees. One exception is the solver, which resides in a separate django project. The django backend service
    is also responsible for this website.<br><br>

    The developer's <a href="https://github.com/Martin-Antonov">github page</a> includes the current GTE software,
    the dissertation version, this website and the backend service.
    <br><br>

    You can access the Flash version of GTE <a href="http://gte.csc.liv.ac.uk/gte/builder/">here</a>
    and the dissertation version <a href="https://lse68123.github.io/">here</a>.</p><br><br>

  <h2 #proj_str>PROJECT STRUCTURE & ARCHITECTURE</h2><br>
  <p>In this section we will look at the design patterns used to create the project. As mentioned in the
    introduction, the project consists of two parts - game trees drawing (with Phaser) and UI (with Angular).</p>
  <br><br>
  <h3 #angular>ANGULAR</h3><br>
  <h4 #cli>COMMAND LINE INTERFACE</h4><br>
  <p>Angular comes with a <a href="https://cli.angular.io/">Command Line Interface (CLI)</a> containing various
    commands such as - creating a new project, serving a project, building a project, creating components, services
    and so on. You can create a new project with the <span> > ng new [project-name] [options]</span> command.
    Angular CLI creates a skeleton for development which includes all necessary configuration files and clear
    structure for the developer to follow.<br><br>

    We should note that Angular uses many external libraries, which are listed in the <span>package.json</span> file.
    These external
    libraries are never included in a github repository - they should be installed with the <span> > npm install</span>
    command which
    looks at the dependencies from the <span>package.json</span> file. By typing the command, npm creates a folder
    called <span>node_modules</span>.
    It includes all necessary external libraries for your project.<br><br>
  </p><br><br>

  <h4 #basics>BASICS</h4><br>
  <p>Angular uses a component-based structure. Each component represents a single well-defined piece of the UI, e.g.
    strategic form component, top menu component and solver window component. Every component has 3 main files - an
    <span>HTML</span> markup file, a <span>CSS</span> styling file and a <span>TS</span> functionality file. The
    additional
    <span>spec.ts</span> file is used for testing purposes. Components can be grouped into modules, but,
    since GTE is a single page application, all components reside in the <span>app-core</span> component.<br><br>

    Services are responsible for receiving and delivering data to the related components via dependency injection.
    For example, there is a solver service, which is responsible for sending the strategic form to a backend service,
    receiving a solution as a response and delivering it to the respective component. Another important service is
    described in the next paragraph.<br><br>

    The UI communicates with the Phaser core via a class called <span>UserActionController.ts</span> (UAC). This class
    is responsible
    for all functionality, related to the creation, modification and presentation of game trees. The UI only needs to
    have access to this class in order to control the behaviour of the tree on the screen. Most components need access
    to this controller and so we have extracted a <span>user-action-controller-service</span>.<br><br>

    One great advantage that comes with Angular services is two-way data-binding. This means that whenever a change
    occurs in UAC, it is immediately detected by the UI. For example, the buttons on the left menu become active or
    inactive, depending on the selected nodes. The project heavily relies on two-way data-binding, which greatly
    simplifies the code.<br><br>
  </p><br><br>

  <h4 #overall_str>OVERALL STRUCTURE</h4><br><br>
  <p>The project repository is essentially an Angular project. In the root folder there are various configuration files
    for code styling options (<span>tslint.json</span>), npm (<span>package.json</span>) and ng commands
    (<span>angular.json</span>), dependencies with other libraries and so on. These are generated by Angular CLI when
    the project is initialized. The application code resides in the <span>/src</span> folder.
    The <span>index.html</span> file contains the main parent component called <span>app-root</span>, which is
    defined in the <span>/app</span> folder. The application starts from <span>main.ts</span>. The
    <span>styles.css</span>
    file is used for general styling. These files are also automatically generated by Angular CLI.<br><br><br><br>

    The <span>/app</span> folder contains the parent <span>app-root</span> component along with folders containing our
    own code. The file <span>app-root.html</span> contains the following components: <span>top-menu</span>,
    <span>left-menu</span>, <span>right-menu</span>, <span>bottom-menu</span> and <span>gte-core</span>. Each of these
    components resides in a separate folder and, if needed, there are subfolders containing child components.
    The <span>gte-core</span> component contains a slightly modified Phaser GTE project.<br><br>

    The <span>/services</span> folder contains all services used in the application. There are 5 services: </p><br>
  <ol>
    <li>UAC service</li>
    <li>Solver service, which sends a request to the backend and receives a solution.</li>
    <li>Tooltips service, which is responsible for the tooltips texts when hovering elements.</li>
    <li>Trees-file service, which handles the bottom menu file structure when creating, saving and loading trees.
    </li>
    <li>UI-settings service currently tracks which of the Strategic form, Matrix Input and Solver windows are
      currently
      active. Should there be any more UI settings, they can be added to this service. If there are settings related to
      the trees and the way they are drawn, there is a separate class inside gte-core which handles this functionality.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <br><br>
  <p>
    The <span>/shared</span> folder contains abstracted css styling functions and colour schemes along with reusable
    components.
    For example, a clickable button with a tooltip can be reused in many other components.
  </p><br><br>
  <h3 #phaser_core>PHASER GTE CORE</h3><br>
  <p>As mentioned in the Introduction, the dissertation version of Phaser has been modified to incorporate the CLEAN
    architecture. In simple terms, different parts of the code are layered, where each outer layer is “allowed”
    access to all inner layers, but inner layers are not “allowed” access to outer layers. This architecture avoids
    circular dependencies and coupling between classes.<br><br>

    In GTE, we still keep the original MVC structure, but the Model, View and Controller modules are now layered.
    In the diagram below, we see that the Model is the innermost layer - it is only concerned with the data and
    corresponding functionality. It should not be coupled with other parts of the code. The View uses the Model to
    visualize the data. The Controller initializes the View and the Model and performs actions based on user
    interaction.
    We should note that no inner layer has knowledge of the outer layers. In this example, the Model is unaware of the
    View and the Controller, and the View is unaware of the Controller.<br><br>

    The same architecture is also applied within the above-mentioned layers. For example, taking the various
    controller classes, we can create a similar diagram.<br><br>

    We should note that the Model layer does not follow this architecture due performance optimizations.<br><br>

    A detailed explanation on the MVC architecture, the various classes, the communication between classes and, in
    general, the implementation of Phaser GTE can be found in the dissertation project
    <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1qR_aQJgeLsbmhwNVIzcXE1MDQ/view">here</a>.<br><br>
